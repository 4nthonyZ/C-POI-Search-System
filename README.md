# Text Search & Inverted Index in C

This project implements a location-based text search engine in C, designed for querying Points of Interest (POIs) by both geographic range and keyword category. It includes:

- Reading and storing POI records with multiple categories
- Query processing using range and keyword match
- Extracting unique categories
- Building an inverted index for fast query lookup

Developed as part of [COMP10002: Foundations of Algorithms](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp10002), University of Melbourne, Semester 1, 2024.
